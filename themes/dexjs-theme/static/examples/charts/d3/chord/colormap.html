<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="ace-info"><h4>Custom Colormap</h4>
This example demonstrates how one might assign a specific colormap to entries
    within the chart.  Presets consist of an object whose keys are the names
    of the data entries and whose values are the colors.  The color may be
    a named color or a hex value of the form #rrggbb.
