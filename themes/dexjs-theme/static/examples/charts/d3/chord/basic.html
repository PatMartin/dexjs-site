This is a basic demonstration of the Chord Diagram.
    <h5>Overview</h5>
    A chord diagram is a graphical method of displaying the inter-relationships between data.
    The entities are arranged radially around a circle and each arc is sized relative to the
    number of interconnections.  Relationships between the entities are represented by chords
    connecting the outer arcs.
