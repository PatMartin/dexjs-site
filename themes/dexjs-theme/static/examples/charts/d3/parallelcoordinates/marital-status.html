This Parallel Coordinates visualization represents a lot of categorical and
    numeric census data related to the marital status of the general population
    of the US.  I have styled the visual so that it more greatly obscures
    data which has not been selected and emphasizes selected data so that
    it is easier to deal with the larger amount of data.
