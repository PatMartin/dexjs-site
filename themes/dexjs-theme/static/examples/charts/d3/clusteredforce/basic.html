This is a basic demonstration of the Clustered Force visualization.
    <h5>Overview</h5>
    Clustered force takes a category dimension, a label dimension and a numeric
    measurement and creates a node for each one colored by the category and
    sized by the numeric measurement.  Nodes of identical categories attract one
    another while nodes of differing categories repel one another.  This produces
    the clustering effect.  The attractive force of each node is proportional to
    the size of the node.
