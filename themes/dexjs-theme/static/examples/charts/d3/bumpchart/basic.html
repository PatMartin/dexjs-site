This is a basic demonstration of a Bump Chart. A bump chart is used to compare a categorical
    dimension along the y axis versus a categorical dimension or measure along the x axis
    (usually time based).  The categories are arranged in ranked order relative to one
    another. They are very useful for exploring the relative changes in Rank of a value over a
    time dimension.
