This is a basic demonstration of the Sunburst Diagram.
    <h5>Overview</h5>
    The Sunburst Diagram is sometimes refered to as a Ring Chart, Multi-level Pie Chart,
    Belt Chart or Radial Treemap.  This visualization depicts a hierarchy as a series of
    concentric rings divided into sections typically proportional to some quantitative
    association within the hierarchy.  Each ring represents a level of the hierarchy
    with the root node at the center and leaf nodes at the outer rings.
