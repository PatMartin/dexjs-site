<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="ace-info"><h4>Time Series Example</h4>
This example demonstrates the use of a time series along the x axis using stacked bars.
    This is great when display space is at a premium or you need to see the value of
    several things combined together, along with their relative proportion to one
    another.
