    <p>
        A heatmap is a graphical representation of data that uses color to represent
        different gradients of values.  This is a basic example which uses a color map
        which depicts the monthly sales of individuals over a year.  The colors rang
        from the blue to yellow to red which symbolize the low, mid and high
        values of the data.

        The color legend at the bottom left is interactive and can be used to isolate
        specific ranges within the heatmap.
