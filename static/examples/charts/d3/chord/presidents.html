<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="ace-info"><h4>Presidents</h4>
This example visualizes the relationship between the presidents and their
    home states.  Since the labels are long, we create large margins so that
    the text does not overflow the visualization.  We also set the inner
    and outer radius for good measure.

This example is good for playing around with data filters.
