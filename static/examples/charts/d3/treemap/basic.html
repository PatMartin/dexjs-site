This is a basic demonstration of a Treemap.
    <h5>Overview</h5>
    The Treemap represents a hierarchical structure through the use of rectangular
    areas representing the top of the hierarchy and further subdivided into sections
    representing the lower layers of the hierarchy, with the area sized by some
    quantitative value associated with the hierarchy.
