This is a basic demonstration of the Orbital Layout adapted for dex.js from

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    The orbital layout as it's name implies, lays out a series of nodes in a radial
    fashion.  The various layers of the hierarchy are represented as orbital bodies
    where the top level of the hierarchy are the central bodies being orbited by
    members of the lower layers of the hierarchy.
