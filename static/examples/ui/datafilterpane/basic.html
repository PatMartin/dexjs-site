    This is a basic demonstration of the Data Filter Pane UI control using the famous
    Iris dataset. This dataset consists of 1550 rows x 5 columns representing
    the dimensions of samples taken from 3 different species of flowers.
    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>The Data Filter Pane UI control allows the user to select which columns to display
        as well as the order in which they are displayed. The user may also filter on
        specific column values; both categorical and numeric. The column filter can
        be used in combination with any dex.js chart. The examples on this page are but
        a few.</p>

    <p>Items in the left side column are actively selected. Items on the right column
        are unselected, but available items. Items may be reordered by dragging selected
        items into the desired position.</p>

    <p>Specific categories may be selected or filtered via the Categorical Filters dropdown.
        Lastly, numerical values may be filtered via the sliders.</p>
