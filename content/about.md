## About dex.js

dex.js was developed to support it's parent project Dex.  Dex provides
a GUI for creating, transforming, outputing and visualizing data.
Initially Dex leveraged a wide variety of HTML libraries to achieve
the task, but it became evident that developing a tool-friendly and
consistent library for accessing these rich data visualizations would
ease the burden of Dex.  And so dex.js was born.

## About Pat

I love to create.  I believe that creating is one of the fundamental
joys of life.  I feel bad for anyone who has not discovered their own
personal creative outlet.

I'm not terribly handy or mechanically inclined.  I can't turn a phrase,
play an instrument or sing a note.  So my creative palette is code.

I enjoy unlocking the mysteries in data, so my chosen coding domain is
data visualization and eventually data analysis and predictive analytics.
