# June 2017 Update

It's been about 6 months since my last update.  There's been a lot of
progress with dex.js worth discussing.  In general, I've been honing
existing visualizations, deprecating a few others, and adding a lot
of new visualizations.

In addition, the framework itself is becoming more and more consumable;
especially for embedding into other tools.
